# Holt-Portfolio
My Personal Portfolio of Work
Hi there, this is a repository to act as a sort of catch all body of work, featuring past classwork and personal projects
as of right now, these are the Projects on this Repository, as listed in the source of this repository:
 * Game
 
 This was a semester long project for software development I, where we developed an underlying engine for a text driven game.
 
 * Housing
 
 This was an class assignment for software development 2, developing a form to list prefrences for housing areas on Marist's campus, and verify if those prefrences match what we had listed in data.
